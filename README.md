### Exploratory Data Analysis on Stock Market Data using Machine Learning Techniques

We used various machine learning methods on stock market data for two purposes.

1. Use of Linear Regression and SVM to predict the stock market variable, by learning past data as training examples and predicting data of present or future. And comparison of these two methods in terms of prediction capability.


2. Use of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to cluster the companies based on univariate time-series data. The dynamic time warping algorithm was used as a distance method between companies time-series data.
